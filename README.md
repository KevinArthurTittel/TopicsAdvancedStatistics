# Topics in Advanced Statistics

For the MSc Econometrics & Management Science, specializing in Business Analytics & Quantitative Marketing [BAQM], at the Erasmus School of Economics [ESE] in Rotterdam, I have written two assignments for the course "Topics in Advanced Statistics" awarded with a 9.8 on average, concerning various topics such as density estimation, optimal bandwidth selection, and bootstrapping.

# Replication Files

This folder contains files for as well as a general introduction for the reader:

- Topics in Advanced Statistics I Question 1.R: Uses bootstrapping on a small synthetic data set in producing a histrogram with a bandwidth that makes the plot informative, examining bias in pointwise estimates and standard errors.
- Topics in Advanced Statistics I Question 2.R: Uses parametric bootstrap, and a self-proposed improved way of bootstrapping, to estimate linear regression coefficients and standard errors, plotted in a histogram.
- Topics in Advanced Statistics I Question 4.R: Density estimation of an unknown distribution on a large dataset using the i) histogram pdf estimator and ii) Gaussian kernel density estimation using various bandwidths (e.g. Silverman's rule-of-thumb, or cross-validated, bandwidth).
